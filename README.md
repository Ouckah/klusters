# README for Algorithms and Data Structures Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to Klusters, a Data Structures and Algorithms Visualization website! This platform is designed to help users understand and visualize a wide range of algorithms and data structures, ranging from simple data structures like binary trees to clustering algorithms like K-Means. It provides an interactive environment where users can engage with various algorithms through dynamic visualizations and hands-on interactions.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Engage with different algorithms and data structures through interactive graphs and visual aids.
- **Wide Range of Topics**: From clustering algorithms to sorting and tree structures, explore a variety of computational concepts.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Website**: Open your preferred browser and go to the website's URL (here)[https://klusters.vercel.app/].
2. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select an algorithm or data structure from the available list to learn more.
3. **Interact and Learn**: Use the interactive features like adding points to graphs or manipulating data structures directly from your browser.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilized for crafting the interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employed for its utility-first approach to responsive design.
- **D3.js**: Integrated in graph components for sophisticated, interactive visualizations.
